*Extensive document on racial biases* in our criminal justice
system.

- Studies seem to indicate *about 61-80% of black overrepresentation in
  prisons* can be explained by *higher black crime rates*, with the
  unexplained portion largely attributable to *racial bias*.

- Remember - the factors which lead to *disproportionate criminality*
  amongst black Americans are also in large part a *product of racial
  bias*. Underfunded public programs, redlining, generational poverty,
  bad schooling, and myriad other factors which *influence criminality*
  can also be traced to *racial bias*.

- *Blacks were more than twice as likely* as whites to be searched after
  traffic stops even after controlling for related variables, though
  *they proved to be 26 percent less likely* to be in possession of
  *illegal drugs or weapons.*

- Between 2011 and 2013,* blacks also received 95 percent of jaywalking
  tickets and 94 percent of tickets for “failure to comply.”* The
  Justice Department also found that the* racial discrepancy for
  speeding tickets increased dramatically* when researchers looked at
  tickets based on only an officer's word vs. tickets *based on
  objective evidence*, such as a radar.

- Black people facing *similar low-level charges as white people* were*
  68 percent less likely to see those charges dismissed in court. More
  than 90 percent *of the arrest warrants stemming from failure to
  pay/failure to appear *were issued for black people.*

- */Enormous/ study* of nearly* 100,000,000 traffic stops* conducted
  across America.

- Analysis finds *the bar for searching black and hispanic drivers'cars*
  is *significantly lower *than the bar for white drivers.

- Additionally, *black drivers are less likely to be pulled over after
  sunset,* when “a ‘veil of darkness'* masks ones'race”*

Abstract:

We assessed racial disparities in policing in the United States by
compiling and analysing a dataset detailing nearly 100 million traffic
stops conducted across the country. We found that black drivers were
less likely to be stopped after sunset, when a ‘veil of darkness’
masks one’s race, suggesting bias in stop decisions. Furthermore, by
examining the rate at which stopped drivers were searched and the
likelihood that searches turned up contraband, we found evidence that
the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that
for searching white drivers. Finally, we found that legalization of
recreational marijuana reduced the number of searches of white, black
and Hispanic drivers—but the bar for searching black and Hispanic
drivers was still lower than that for white drivers
post-legalization. Our results indicate that police stops and search
decisions suffer from persistent racial bias and point to the value of
policy interventions to mitigate these disparities.

- Extensive multivariate regression analysis indicates* black male
  offenders receive 19.1% longer federal sentences than
  similarly-situated white male offenders* (white male offenders with
  similar past offenses, socioeconomic background, etc.)

- This disparity seems to stem mostly from *black males being 21.2% less
  likely to receive non-government sponsored downward departures or
  variances*.

  - *Non-government sponsored departures and variances* refer to
    deviations from standard sentencing guidelines due to* judicial
    discretion*.

- Black males who *do receive* non government-sponsored departures and
  variations *still serve 16.8% longer sentences than white males on
  average*.

- In contrast, *when sentencing length follows standard guidelines, that
  disparity is only 7.9%*, and a substantial assistance departure for
  both groups *nullifies that disparity*.

- *_IN__ __SUMMARY_* - much of the sentencing disparity between*
  similarly situated black males and white males* comes down to*
  judicial discretion* to *deviate from standard sentencing guidelines.*

- *_BONUS_ -* regression analysis suggests *violence in a criminal's
  history does NOT *explain *sentencing disparities between black males
  and similarly situated white males* - the effect of that factor seems
  to be *statistically insignificant.*

- ADDENDUM - Some have asked me to clarify a sentence at the end of
  this report, where its authors write it cannot be used to prove
  discrimination on the part of judges. First, that disclaimer warns
  against inferring active discrimination as opposed to implicit
  bias - the disclaimer does not say the report cannot be used to
  prove implicit bias. Second, researchers are often quick to point
  out their research cannot prove a point, especially regarding
  intent. It can only strongly suggest a point - natural limitation of
  multivariate regression analysis.

- *ENORMOUS* meta-meta-analysis on transgender people and the effect
  gender transition has on their mental health

- *Of 56 studies, 52 *indicated transitioning has a* positive effect* on
  the mental health of transgender people and *4* indicated it had*
  mixed or no results*.

- *ZERO* studies indicated gender transitioning has *negative results*

- *This pretty much ends the argument right here.*

"This search found a robust international consensus in the
peer-reviewed literature that gender transition, including medical
treatments such as hormone therapy and surgeries, improves the overall
well-being of transgender individuals. The literature also indicates
that greater availability of medical and social support for gender
transition contributes to better quality of life for those who
identify as transgender."

* Holocaust Denial

*There is an enormous body of historical research concerning the
Holocaust, none of which holocaust deniers care to engage with. They are
conspiracists, regurgitating already-debunked talking points which
“question the official narrative”but do not engage with existing
research. This is because, no matter how tenacious they are in their
ignorance, their talking points are very easy to disprove. Here are a
few rebuttals to those talking points, though not all unsubstantiated
denier claims warranted an academic paper in response.

The Liberal Sanity Project, who helped with this document, has a good
video on this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_YFgugVhns&t=1s][link]]

** “The estimated number of Jewish deaths in the Holocaust is wildly overinflated.” argument
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/76avmk/how_do_we_estimate_the_number_of_jewish_deaths_in/doco9me/][This extensive and well sourced post]] explains how modern historians
  arrived at their estimation of Jewish Holocaust deaths (5.4 - 6.2
  million).

- There is lively academic debate within that range (Nazis kept poor
  records so we will never have a completely accurate answer) but no
  serious historian believes in any figure which deviates significantly
  from that range.

- A passage from /Denying History/ - /Historians are the ones who should
  be described as revisionists. To receive a Ph.D. and become a
  professional historian, one must write an original work with research
  based on primary documents and new sources, reexamining or
  reinterpreting some historical event---in other words, revising
  knowledge about that event only. This is not to say, however, that
  revision is done for revision's sake; it is done when new evidence or
  new interpretations call for a revision./

- Historians have revised and continue to revise what we know about the
  Holocaust. But their revision entails refinement of detailed knowledge
  about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and
  certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the
  Holocaust.
  
- Holocaust deniers claim that there is a force field of dogma around the
  Holocaust---set up and run by the Jews themselves---shielding it from
  any change. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether or not the
  public is aware of the academic debates that take place in any field of
  study, Holocaust scholars discuss and argue over any number of points as
  research continues. Deniers do know this.

** arguments of Zyklon B
Zyklon B is just a delousing agent, it can’t kill people! It was used
to clean clothes! Also, even if it was lethal, why do some “gas
chambers” [[https://i.imgur.com/X5n9l6f.jpg][lack the blue stain Zyklon B leaves on walls?]]”

- First of all, Zyklon B can absolutely be used to kill. Just Wikipedia
  it.

- Secondly, Zyklon B must be used in higher concentrations to kill lice
  than it need be to kill humans. It's more economical to use less gas,
  so the blue gas residue wouldn't form as easily in gas chambers.

- Third, Zyklon B residue can be easily cleaned from walls, and Nazis
  made every effort to destroy evidence of the Holocaust as Soviet
  soldiers marched in.

- Fourth, even this stupid image acknowledges there are traces of
  (again, easily-cleanable) Zyklon B in the gas chamber.

** “The Auschwitz memorial plaque death figure suddenly CHANGED from 4 million dead to 1.5 million dead. What are they hiding?”
([[https://i.imgur.com/P1scrSN.jpg][link]])

- The 4 million figure was initially published by the Soviet State
  Commission in 1945, long before any reliable estimates were available.

- As new information is made available, historians revise general
  knowledge of the subject. This is how the field of history works.

** “The “gas chamber” doors were made from WOOD. They clearly weren’t meant to contain people.”
([[https://i.imgur.com/iQ4blnJ.jpg][link]])

- The wooden doors presented in these images led to delousing rooms, not
  gas chambers. These are literally just pictures of wooden doors. It is
  not known what the original gas chamber doors looked like because
  Nazis destroyed those facilities before Soviet soldiers arrived.

- [[https://i.imgur.com/A0T8lNZ.jpg][this door]], however, was found in the building yard of Auschwitz and is believed
  to be the kind used in their gas chambers.

- The doors may have been destroyed, but the receipts for those doors
  were not. [[https://i.imgur.com/1ZRz9FO.png][This receipt]] calls for an order /“on 6/3/1943 concerning
  the delivery of a gas tight door 100 x 192 cm for cellar I of
  Krematorium III, to be produced to the identical pattern and
  dimensions as the cellar door of Krematorium II which is situated
  opposite, with peephole of double 8 mm glass, with rubber sealing
  strip and frame.”/

** “The camp crematoriums could not have handled that many bodies! It takes 4-8 hours to cremate a body.”

- It takes 1-5 hours to cremate a /civilian/ body at a /professional
  service/. It takes far less time to cremate a body in an industrial
  furnace when speed takes priority over cleanliness and decency.

- Also, Holocaust victims were not cremated one at a time. Toph and Sons
  (the makers of the Auschwitz crematoriums) claimed their units could
  handle 4-6 bodies an hour.

- /The bodies were ". . . sorted according to their combustibility: for
  the bodies of the well-nourished were to help burn the emaciated.
  Under the direction of the Kapos, the bearers began sorting the dead
  into four stacks. The largest consisted mainly of strong men, the next
  in size of women, then came children, and lastly a stack of dead
  Mussulmans, emaciated and nothing but skin and bones. This technique
  was called 'express work,' a designation thought up by the
  Kommandoführers and originating from experiments carried out in
  crematorium 5 in the autumn of 1943. The purpose of these experiments
  was to find a way of saving coke. . . . Thus the bodies of two
  Mussulmans were cremated together with those of two children or the
  bodies of two well-nourished men together with that of an emaciated
  woman, each load consisting of three, or sometimes, four bodies."
  Filip Müller, Sonderkommando - Filip Müller/

- When crematoriums failed, they used burning pits.

** “The Red Cross visited a “death camp” and found that it wasn’t inhumane!”

- The Red Cross inspectors were not allowed to visit the parts of the
  camp intended for genocide and the had Nazis prepared their camp for
  scrutiny, deporting the near-dead and sanitizing the presented
  facilities.

- "I repeatedly witnessed guided tours of civilians and also of
  commissions of the Red Cross and other parties within the camp, and I
  was able to ascertain that the camp leadership arranged it masterfully
  to conduct these guided tours in such a way that the people being
  guided around did not see a*hing about inhuman treatment. The main
  camp was shown only and in this main camp there were so-called show
  blocks, particularly block 13, that were especially prepared for such
  guided tours and that were equipped like a normal soldier's barracks
  with beds that had sheets on them, and well-functioning washrooms." -
  SS-Untersturmführer Hans Münch

- Additionally, that letter tallying camp deaths is attributable to the
  International Tracing Service, not the Red Cross. They tally
  estimates, not records, and are not historically relevant.

** “The prisoners at Auschwitz had a swimming pool! And a band! And a brothel! And a goddamn soccer team! And a dentist! Some prison, huh?”
([[https://jan27.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/auschwitz-swimming-pool-ladder.jpg][link]])
- All these amenities were present at Auschwitz I - the main camp,
  which held POWs, not Holocaust victims. The infamous extermination
  camp was Auschwitz-Birkenau. Also, the band and “pool”were for the
  guards exclusively. The “pool's”main purpose [[http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2017/05/rebutting-twitter-denial-most-popular.html#auschwitzswimmingpool][was actually that of a
  backup water reservoir]].

- Even if these amenities were present at Auschwitz-Birkenau, it
  wouldn't disprove anything concerning the Holocaust.
