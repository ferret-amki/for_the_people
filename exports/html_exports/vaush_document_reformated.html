<li>Studies seem to indicate <b>about 61-80% of black overrepresentation in

Abstract:
</p>

<p>
We assessed racial disparities in policing in the United States by
compiling and analysing a dataset detailing nearly 100 million traffic
stops conducted across the country. We found that black drivers were
less likely to be stopped after sunset, when a ‘veil of darkness’
masks one’s race, suggesting bias in stop decisions. Furthermore, by
examining the rate at which stopped drivers were searched and the
likelihood that searches turned up contraband, we found evidence that
the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that
for searching white drivers. Finally, we found that legalization of
recreational marijuana reduced the number of searches of white, black
and Hispanic drivers—but the bar for searching black and Hispanic
drivers was still lower than that for white drivers
post-legalization. Our results indicate that police stops and search
decisions suffer from persistent racial bias and point to the value of
policy interventions to mitigate these disparities.

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Extensive multivariate regression analysis indicates* black male
offenders receive 19.1% longer federal sentences than
similarly-situated white male offenders* (white male offenders with
similar past offenses, socioeconomic background, etc.)</li>

<li>This disparity seems to stem mostly from *black males being 21.2% less
likely to receive non-government sponsored downward departures or
variances*.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Non-government sponsored departures and variances</b> refer to
deviations from standard sentencing guidelines due to* judicial
discretion*.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Black males who <b>do receive</b> non government-sponsored departures and
variations <b>still serve 16.8% longer sentences than white males on
average</b>.</li>

<li>In contrast, <b>when sentencing length follows standard guidelines, that
disparity is only 7.9%</b>, and a substantial assistance departure for
both groups <b>nullifies that disparity</b>.</li>

<li><b><span class="underline">IN_</span> <span class="underline">_SUMMARY</span></b> - much of the sentencing disparity between*
similarly situated black males and white males* comes down to*
judicial discretion* to <b>deviate from standard sentencing guidelines.</b></li>

<li><b><span class="underline">BONUS</span> -</b> regression analysis suggests *violence in a criminal's
history does NOT <b>explain *sentencing disparities between black males
and similarly situated white males</b> - the effect of that factor seems
to be <b>statistically insignificant.</b></li>

<li>ADDENDUM - Some have asked me to clarify a sentence at the end of
this report, where its authors write it cannot be used to prove
discrimination on the part of judges. First, that disclaimer warns
against inferring active discrimination as opposed to implicit
bias - the disclaimer does not say the report cannot be used to
prove implicit bias. Second, researchers are often quick to point
out their research cannot prove a point, especially regarding
intent. It can only strongly suggest a point - natural limitation of
multivariate regression analysis.</li>

Longitudinal study comparing the <b>change in social cohesion over time</b>
in an area which <b>experienced a large increase in diversity</b> with a
<b>comparative control which didn't.</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The two areas <b>did not differ significantly</b> in how their levels of
<b>social cohesion changed over time</b>, suggesting the increased level of
diversity had <b>no statistically significant impact on social

Another longitudinal study analyzing <b>changes in trust in 22 European
countries *between the years *2002 and 2010</b>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Study suggests <b>immigration often leads to decrease in social trust</b>,
but results were* heavily affected by ethnic polarization &amp; economic
stability*.</li>

<li>With low polarization and a good economy, immigration was shown to
actually <b>increase social trust</b>.</li>

<li>Results suggest <b>it isn't the diversity of immigrants</b> which lessens
trust, but rather the <b>economic and political context in which they
arrive.</b></li>

<p>
*There is an enormous body of historical research concerning the
Holocaust, none of which holocaust deniers care to engage with. They are
conspiracists, regurgitating already-debunked talking points which
“question the official narrative”but do not engage with existing
research. This is because, no matter how tenacious they are in their
ignorance, their talking points are very easy to disprove. Here are a
few rebuttals to those talking points, though not all unsubstantiated
denier claims warranted an academic paper in response.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/76avmk/how_do_we_estimate_the_number_of_jewish_deaths_in/doco9me/">This extensive and well sourced post</a> explains how modern historians
arrived at their estimation of Jewish Holocaust deaths (5.4 - 6.2
million).</li>

<li>There is lively academic debate within that range (Nazis kept poor
records so we will never have a completely accurate answer) but no
serious historian believes in any figure which deviates significantly
from that range.</li>

<li>A passage from <i>Denying History</i> - /Historians are the ones who should
be described as revisionists. To receive a Ph.D. and become a
professional historian, one must write an original work with research
based on primary documents and new sources, reexamining or
reinterpreting some historical event&#x2014;in other words, revising
knowledge about that event only. This is not to say, however, that
revision is done for revision's sake; it is done when new evidence or
new interpretations call for a revision./</li>

<li>Historians have revised and continue to revise what we know about the
Holocaust. But their revision entails refinement of detailed knowledge
about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and
certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the
Holocaust.</li>

<li>Holocaust deniers claim that there is a force field of dogma around the
Holocaust&#x2014;set up and run by the Jews themselves&#x2014;shielding it from
any change. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether or not the
public is aware of the academic debates that take place in any field of
study, Holocaust scholars discuss and argue over any number of points as
research continues. Deniers do know this.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Zyklon B is just a delousing agent, it can’t kill people! It was used
to clean clothes! Also, even if it was lethal, why do some “gas
chambers” <a href="https://i.imgur.com/X5n9l6f.jpg">lack the blue stain Zyklon B leaves on walls?</a>”
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First of all, Zyklon B can absolutely be used to kill. Just Wikipedia
it.</li>

<li>Secondly, Zyklon B must be used in higher concentrations to kill lice
than it need be to kill humans. It's more economical to use less gas,
so the blue gas residue wouldn't form as easily in gas chambers.</li>

<li>Third, Zyklon B residue can be easily cleaned from walls, and Nazis
made every effort to destroy evidence of the Holocaust as Soviet
soldiers marched in.</li>

<li>Fourth, even this stupid image acknowledges there are traces of
(again, easily-cleanable) Zyklon B in the gas chamber.</li>

<li>Also, Holocaust victims were not cremated one at a time. Toph and Sons
(the makers of the Auschwitz crematoriums) claimed their units could
handle 4-6 bodies an hour.</li>

<li>/The bodies were ". . . sorted according to their combustibility: for
the bodies of the well-nourished were to help burn the emaciated.
Under the direction of the Kapos, the bearers began sorting the dead
into four stacks. The largest consisted mainly of strong men, the next
in size of women, then came children, and lastly a stack of dead
Mussulmans, emaciated and nothing but skin and bones. This technique
was called 'express work,' a designation thought up by the
Kommandoführers and originating from experiments carried out in
crematorium 5 in the autumn of 1943. The purpose of these experiments
was to find a way of saving coke. . . . Thus the bodies of two
Mussulmans were cremated together with those of two children or the
bodies of two well-nourished men together with that of an emaciated
woman, each load consisting of three, or sometimes, four bodies."

commissions of the Red Cross and other parties within the camp, and I
was able to ascertain that the camp leadership arranged it masterfully
to conduct these guided tours in such a way that the people being
guided around did not see a*hing about inhuman treatment. The main
camp was shown only and in this main camp there were so-called show
blocks, particularly block 13, that were especially prepared for such
